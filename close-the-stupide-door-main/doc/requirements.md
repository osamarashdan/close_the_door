# Project Requirements

## Frige Door Detector

### Overview

Our project focuses on developing a Fridge Door Detector using two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices. The primary goal is to create standalone devices capable of connecting to the internet via WiFi. These devices will have the capability to monitor and report temperature and humidity levels.

### Features

1. **Standalone Operation:**
   - The Fridge Door Detector, two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices that can operate independently.

2. **Internet Connectivity:**
   - Both devices must be capable of connecting to the internet using WiFi.

3. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:**
   - Implement sensors or modules to accurately read and monitor temperature and humidity levels.
   - Devices should provide real-time data on environmental conditions.

4. **Alert Mechanism:**
   - Integrate an alert system that notifies users when predefined temperature or humidity thresholds are exceeded.
   - Alerts sent through (NTFY), Get a notification on the phone.

5. **Power :**
   - Addapter to the wall.

6. **Data Logging:**
   - Log temperature and humidity data for analysis.


### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to set up the Fridge Door Detector easily.

2. As a user, I want the devices to operate independently without the need for constant manual intervention.

3. As a user, I want the option to view real-time temperature and humidity data through a user-friendly interface.

4. As a user, I want the devices to have minimal impact on my energy consumption.

5. As a user, I want the Fridge Door Detector to maintain a record of temperature and humidity trends for analysis.
